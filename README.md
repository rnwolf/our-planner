# Task Resource Manager application

## About

The Task Resource Manager application...

# Application Structure

The application is structuredinto a modular structure with multiple files to make it more maintainable and to avoid hitting token limits.

Implementation Guidelines
Step 1: Create the Model Layer

Create a new file model.py with the TaskResourceModel class
Move all data-related code from existing files to the model
Add proper methods for data access and manipulation
Remove UI dependencies from the model

Step 2: Refactor the Controller

Update task_manager.py to use the new model
Remove direct data manipulation code
Keep UI interaction state in the controller
Add methods to coordinate between model and view

Step 3: Update UI Components

Modify ui_components.py to reference the model through the controller
Focus on rendering and UI behavior
Handle user input and delegate model changes to the controller
Keep track of UI-specific elements (canvas items, coordinates)

Step 4: Update Operations Classes

Modify file_operations.py and task_operations.py to work with the model
Remove direct data manipulation
Use model methods for data operations
Update UI through the controller

Step 5: Test Each Component

Test the model independently
Test UI components with mock data
Test operations with model and UI integration
Verify full functionality

Best Practices To Follow
For the Model

No UI dependencies: The model should never import Tkinter or other UI libraries
Complete API: Provide all necessary methods for data access and manipulation
Encapsulation: Keep internal data structures private when possible
Validation: Validate inputs before making changes to the model

For the Controller

Minimal state: Keep only necessary state for user interactions
Coordinate, don't implement: Delegate implementations to appropriate classes
Keep UI and model separate: Never let model directly access UI or vice versa

For the View

Render, don't change data: UI components should focus on rendering, not data manipulation
Delegate actions: Pass user actions to the controller
Manage UI state: Keep track of UI-specific elements and states
